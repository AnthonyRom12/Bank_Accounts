# Bank_Accounts
There are some scripts for creating a simple bank account.

The first version is a simple version for creating a bank account.
The second version also is a simple, but I started to add a function 
The third version has two accounts 
The fourth version is more complex than others - there you can create a numbers of accounts.

All this codes are created for begginers who only start to learn coding with Python.
Good luck !
